<summary>How do I enable dev mode?</summary>

Simple! All you have to do is type /admin and navigate through the menu to the last section called "Developer Options" and inside there you should see "Dev Mode", this will keep you invincible and add a cool developer icon in your circles/radials

<summary>What does the purple circle/radial do?</summary>

That is your harness indicator! When you have the item "harness" in your inventory and while in a vehicle it will appear. Also, when you use your item "harness", the circle/radial will reflect the amount of uses left and decrease over time.
