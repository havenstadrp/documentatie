## Configuration

!!! danger
    DO NOT CHANGE THE DEFAULT BANK DOORS IN THE CONFIG IF USING QB-BANKROBBERY


!!! info
    The door id is the index of the door config table


### General

```lua
Config = {}
Config.CommandPermission = 'god' -- permission level for creating new doors
Config.AdminAccess = false -- Enable admins to unlock any door
Config.AdminPermission = 'god' -- The permission needed to get AdminAccess if it is enabled
Config.Warnings = false -- if true it will show warnings in the console when certain requirements aren't met
Config.FallbackDistance = 3.0 -- Distance to fall back on when it is not set
Config.EnableSounds = true -- Enable sounds when unlocking/locking doors (doors triggered by scripts can have the sound manually disabled)
Config.EnableAnimation = true -- Enable the animation when unlocking/locking doors (doors triggered by scripts can have the animation manually disabled)
Config.SaveDoorDialog = true -- Saves the door dialogue popup between door saves
Config.PersistentDoorStates = false -- Persists the door state between server restarts
Config.PersistentSaveInternal = 60000 -- How often door states are saved to the file system, in miliseconds.
```

### Door Labels/Colors

```lua
Config.ChangeColor = false -- Change the color of the box of the popup text based on if it is locked or not
Config.DefaultColor = 'rgb(19, 28, 74)' -- The default color of the box of the popup text if Config.ChangeColor is false
Config.LockedColor = 'rgb(219 58 58)' -- The color of the box of the popup text if Config.ChangeColor is true and the door is locked
Config.UnlockedColor = 'rgb(27 195 63)' -- The color of the box of the popup text if Config.ChangeColor is true and the door is unlocked
Config.UseDoorLabelText = false -- Will use the LABEL field as the nui text instead of locked/unlocked
Config.DoorDebug = false -- Enable DRAWTEXT in the world at the coords where the door 'center' is
Config.RemoteTriggerDistance = 15.0 -- This is how far from your camera the raycast will go to try to hit something solid
Config.RemoteTriggerMinDistance = 5.0 -- This is the minimum distance required for the raycast hit to count near a door. It will take the larger two between this and 'distance' option
```

### Item Removal

```lua
Config.Consumables = { -- The items will get removed once used on a door that has the item on it
    ['ticket'] = 1, -- item name and amount
    ['paperclip'] = 1
}
```

# ðŸ”¨ qb-vehiclefailure

## Introduction

* Handles the logic for vehicle damage
* Has handling logic like `sundayDriver`&#x20;

!!! info
    This resource is just a modified version of [Realistic Vehicle Failure](https://github.com/StockholmCityRP/fivem-realisticvehicle)


## Configuration

### General

```lua
deformationMultiplier = -1, -- How much should the vehicle visually deform from a collision. Range 0.0 to 10.0 Where 0.0 is no deformation and 10.0 is 10x deformation. -1 = Don't touch. Visual damage does not sync well to other players.
deformationExponent = 0.5, -- How much should the handling file deformation setting be compressed toward 1.0. (Make cars more similar). A value of 1=no change. Lower values will compress more, values above 1 it will expand. Dont set to zero or negative.
collisionDamageExponent = 0.5,	-- How much should the handling file deformation setting be compressed toward 1.0. (Make cars more similar). A value of 1=no change. Lower values will compress more, values above 1 it will expand. Dont set to zero or negative.
damageFactorEngine = 3.0, -- Some values are 1 to 100. Higher values means more damage to vehicle. A good starting point is 10
damageFactorBody = 3.0,	-- Some values are 1 to 100. Higher values means more damage to vehicle. A good starting point is 10
damageFactorPetrolTank = 32.0,	-- Some values are 1 to 200. Higher values means more damage to vehicle. A good starting point is 64
engineDamageExponent = 0.3,-- How much should the handling file engine damage setting be compressed toward 1.0. (Make cars more similar). A value of 1=no change. Lower values will compress more, values above 1 it will expand. Dont set to zero or negative.
weaponsDamageMultiplier = 1.2, -- How much damage should the vehicle get from weapons fire. Range 0.0 to 10.0, where 0.0 is no damage and 10.0 is 10x damage. -1 = don't touch
degradingHealthSpeedFactor = 2,	-- Speed of slowly degrading health, but not failure. Value of 10 means that it will take about 0.25 second per health point, so degradation from 800 to 305 will take about 2 minutes of clean driving. Higher values means faster degradation
cascadingFailureSpeedFactor = 4.0, -- Some values are 1 to 100. When vehicle health drops below a certain point, cascading failure sets in, and the health drops rapidly until the vehicle dies. Higher values means faster failure. A good starting point is 8
degradingFailureThreshold = 250.0, -- Below this value, slow health degradation will set in
cascadingFailureThreshold = 200.0, -- Below this value, health cascading failure will set in
engineSafeGuard = 50.0,	-- Final failure value. Set it too high, and the vehicle won't smoke when disabled. Set too low, and the car will catch fire from a single bullet to the engine. At health 100 a typical car can take 3-4 bullets to the engine before catching fire.
torqueMultiplierEnabled = true,	-- Decrease engine torque as engine gets more and more damaged
limpMode = false, -- If true, the engine never fails completely, so you will always be able to get to a mechanic unless you flip your vehicle and preventVehicleFlip is set to true
limpModeMultiplier = 0.15, -- The torque multiplier to use when vehicle is limping. Sane values are 0.05 to 0.25
preventVehicleFlip = true, -- If true, you can't turn over an upside down vehicle
sundayDriver = true, -- If true, the accelerator response is scaled to enable easy slow driving. Will not prevent full throttle. Does not work with binary accelerators like a keyboard. Set to false to disable. The included stop-without-reversing and brake-light-hold feature does also work for keyboards.
sundayDriverAcceleratorCurve = 7.5, -- The response curve to apply to the accelerator. Range 0.0 to 10.0. Higher values enables easier slow driving, meaning more pressure on the throttle is required to accelerate forward. Does nothing for keyboard drivers
sundayDriverBrakeCurve = 5.0, -- The response curve to apply to the Brake. Range 0.0 to 10.0. Higher values enables easier braking, meaning more pressure on the throttle is required to brake hard. Does nothing for keyboard drivers
displayBlips = false, -- Show blips for mechanics locations
compatibilityMode = false, -- prevents other scripts from modifying the fuel tank health to avoid random engine failure with BVA 2.01 (Downside is it disabled explosion prevention)
randomTireBurstInterval = 0, -- Number of minutes (statistically, not precisely) to drive above 22 mph before you get a tire puncture. 0=feature is disabled

## Introduction

* Handles the logic of locking/lockpicking and robbing cars
* Aim a gun at a ped driver for a chance to rob their keys

## Configuration

### General

```lua
Config.HotwireChance = 0.5 -- chance for successful hotwire or not

Config.RemoveLockpickNormal = 0.5 -- chance to remove lockpick on fail
Config.RemoveLockpickAdvanced = 0.2 -- chance to remove advanced lockpick on fail

Config.CarjackingTime = 7500 -- progress bar time
Config.DelayBetweenCarjackings = 10000 -- cooldown between car jacking

Config.TimeBetweenHotwires = 5000 -- cooldown between hotwire actions
Config.minHotwireTime = 20000 -- progress bar time
Config.maxHotwireTime = 40000 -- progress bar time

Config.AlertCooldown = 10000 -- cooldown between police alerts in milliseconds
Config.PoliceAlertChance = 1.75 -- chance of alerting police during the day
Config.PoliceNightAlertChance = 1.50 -- chance of alerting police at night

Config.ImmuneVehicles = { -- These vehicles cannot be jacked
    'stockade'
}

Config.NoLockVehicles = { -- These vehicles cannot be locked
    'adder'
}
```

### Blacklisted weapons

    "WEAPON_UNARMED",
    "WEAPON_Knife",
    "WEAPON_Nightstick",

}
```

### Car jack chance

```lua
Config.CarjackChance = { -- this is the percentage chance of succesful car jacking
    ['2685387236'] = 0.0,   -- melee
    ['416676503'] = 0.5,   -- handguns
    ['337201093'] = 0.75,   -- SMG
