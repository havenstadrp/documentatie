## Waar te beginnen?

The community offers support for the framework through [Discord](https://discord.gg/qbcore) and [Guilded](https://guilded.gg/qbcore)

The easiest way to get started with a QBCore server is to use the txAdmin recipe built into their platform! To begin setting up your server you can refer to [windows-installation.md](guides/windows-installation.md "mention") or [linux-installation.md](guides/linux-installation.md "mention"). If you have more questions about txAdmin then feel free to join their [discord](https://discord.gg/r7d894sTHA).
